# Researchers-in-AI4S

This is the summary for researchers in AI for Science. Currently, the updating list only contained people in the field of AI + applied mathematics and mechanics sorted by Shizheng Wen. Other fields like AI + Molecular dynamics, materials/chemistry/biology will be sorted out soon.

(:notebook: Please ignore the note, which is some characteristics for me to remember.) 

# :man_scientist:Mainstream ML

Most of the following researchers have a strong background in applied mathematics (numerical analysis and dynamical systems) and data science (machine learning, optimization and statistics), and come from the department of computer science and mathematics in different universities or research institutes (DeepMind, MSR, Google and etc.). They are in the mainstream machine learning community and perfer to publish paper in machine learning conference.

# :man_scientist:Domain field ML

Follwing researchers often have a strong domain knowledge in mechanics (solid or fluid) and work on developing data-driven modeling in science and technology by utilizing algorithms from machine learning community. They are not interested in advancing new machine learning algorithm, and prefer publishing their works in top-tier journals.
